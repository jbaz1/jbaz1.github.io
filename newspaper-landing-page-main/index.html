        <p> Nestled in southwestern Pennsylvania, Allegheny County is home to over 1.2 million people, Pennsylvania’s second most populous city, and one of the more intriguing public workforce breakdowns in the United States. Racially, Allegheny County has a very similar breakdown to that of the United States.   <a href="https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/alleghenycountypennsylvania/PST045223"> 79.1% of the workforce in Allegheny County is white, 13.5% is Black, and 2.5% are Hispanic</a>, compared to figures of    <a href="https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/US/PST045221">75.5%, 13.6%, and 19% for the entire nation according to the 2020 census (respondents who identify as Latino were put into the “white” category). </a> </p>
           
    <p>In terms of gender, Allegheny County’s 6,270 public employees are nearly perfectly split between male and female. Yet despite the strong number of women in the public workforce, men earn an average of $8,000 more than their female counterparts. The gender pay gap, the widely accepted notion that men make more than women, states that women make 82 cents for every dollar men make. This figure is slightly better in Allegheny County, with women making 86 cents per male dollar. </p>

  <p> Traditional gender norms still exist in the job breakup between males and females. Blue collar jobs, with more physical labor and hands on work, are still dominated by men, including correctional officers, laborers, and police officers. Female workers strongly control fields long associated with their gender, such as telecommunications officer, nursing assistant, and total caseworkers. Chris Bailey, a University of Pittsburgh graduate and employee within Allegheny County for seven years, points out the region’s background as a steel manufacturing hub may be the cause for the lack of progress past gender-stereotypical jobs. 
</p>

        <p>“Pittsburgh was a major center for the second industrial revolution with many blue collar jobs,” Bailey explained. “Gender diversity in jobs is slowly improving, but the city’s traditional roots could explain why it hasn’t matured as quickly as other cities such as Philadelphia.” </p>

    <p>Unfortunately, job and pay discrepancies in Allegheny County don’t exist just between genders. The average salary for African American public workers is barely $51,000, while their white counterparts make nearly $57,000 on average. Latino workers find themselves in the same shoes as their black coworkers, making an average salary just over $52,000. Bailey mentioned that there isn’t just one easy explanation for the pay difference between races. </p>
         
        <p> Systemic racism, the region’s blue collar origin, and many other factors play into the fact that qualified African Americans and Latinos can work the same exact jobs yet still get paid less in comparison to white workers. </p>

    <p></p>A factor as to why African Americans and Latinos are earning less than their white counterparts is job diversity within the county. For all attorneys, a position in Allegheny County that brings in an average salary of over $66,000, well over $10,000 the average salary for all jobs in the county, is completely dominated by white workers. 138 out of the 151 total attorneys in the county are white, with just three identifying as Black and one attorney having a Hispanic ethnicity. 
</p>

        <p>Again, Bailey acknowledges that he and other white, male, college educated workers had all the cards in their favor, and never faced any discrimination or challenges that pushed them away from any high paying occupation in Allegheny County. But even in average paying jobs relative to Allegheny County, such as Telecommunications Officer, who’s average salary is around $53,000, white workers make up over 89% of the position, while African Americans make up just 9% and hispanics are less than 1%. </p>

    <p>It is important to note that while Pittsburgh and Allegheny County’s niche origin as a steel city may explain part of the reason why the region lags behind other urban areas in terms of pay equality for all genders and ethnicities, it doesn’t tell the entire story. Many factors, including hiring discrimination, disparity in educational opportunities, family history, and dozens more continue to play a role in the uneven trends we see in both the Allegheny County job market and the United States as a whole. </p>

   <p> Many individual companies and public sectors have openly acknowledged the issue of unevenness in jobs and pay between genders and ethnicities. Many local, state, and even the federal government have passed equal pay legislation. </p>
         
        <p>Private companies have set up training modules and initiatives for their employees to learn about sexist and racist biases in the workplace. In Allegheny County, a region that closely mirrors the gender and ethnic makeup of the United States, it will be interesting to see what county officials do, if anything, to try and curb these longstanding trends.
